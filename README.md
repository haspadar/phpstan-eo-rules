## 📦 About

A collection of PHPStan rules enforcing the principles of Elegant Objects:
immutability, composition, no static state, and explicit contracts.

This package is currently under development.  
Rules will be added in upcoming releases.

## Releases

Release notes are automatically generated by GitHub Release Drafter from merged pull requests and categorized by their labels.

To finalize a release:

1. Create a new version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`)
2. Push the tag to `main`

This publishes the current draft release with the generated changelog.
